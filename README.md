# Buszy

A mobile app that uses the help of the community to make the bus system in Miami more reliable for riders. 

This prototype was designed to get the community involved and incentivize users to input real-time transit data that can help other riders and increase reliability of the buses for the overall community. While the app does not yet have full functionality, the basic framework and design accurately depicts our goal at Buszy.

The mockup was built using Bravo Vision, Figma, Google Maps Platform, and Glitch.
